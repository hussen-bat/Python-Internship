# Student Grade Calculator
## Project Description
```
A comprehensive grade calculator that processes multiple students' marks, calculates grades with personalized comments, and provides class statistics.
```

## What I Learned
```
Conditional Logic: Using if/elif/else for decision making
Lists: Storing and manipulating collections of data
Loops: Using for and while loops for repetition
Error Handling: Using try-except to handle invalid inputs
Functions: Organizing code into reusable blocks
Features
✓- Processes multiple students
✓- Calculates grades based on custom grading system
✓- Provides personalized comments for each student
✓- Calculates class statistics (average, highest, lowest)
✓- Formatted table output with color coding
✓- Input validation for all user inputs
✓- Error handling for edge cases
✓- Search functionality for specific students
✓- Save results to file option
```
## How to Run
```bash 
# Navigate to project folder
